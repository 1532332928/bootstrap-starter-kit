## Getting Started

For easier asset management we've chosen [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). If you want to see all the npm scripts included for this starter kit, open the `package.json` file.

Next, navigate to the root folder of the site and run:

```
npm install
```

To run a local server and watch for changes:

```
npm start
```

To build for production:

```
npm run build
```
